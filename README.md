# flattenarray
Flatten nested arrays, a job application exercise

To see it work,
```
git clone https://github.com/eschiebel/flattenarray.git
cd flattenarray
npm install
npm test
```

There are two implementations
- `flattenarray.js` uses Array.reduce
- `flattenarray2.js` is all hand-crafted

You can pick which one to run by commenting out the appropriate line
near the top of  `test/flattenarray-tests.js`
